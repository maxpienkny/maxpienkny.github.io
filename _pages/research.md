 I examine how the sudden and widespread deregulation of radio content in the United States—prompted by the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) 1987 repeal of the Fairness Doctrine—transformed both local politics and public health outcomes. The Fairness Doctrine, introduced in 1949, required broadcast stations to devote “reasonable attention” to controversial public issues and to “air contrasting sides” of those issues. The sudden repeal of the doctrine led to an immediate and widespread expansion of talk radio, which came to be dominated by conservative voices such as Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, each of whom reached over 10 million weekly listeners throughout the 2000s. I find that quasi-exogenous exposure to the rise of conservative talk radio in the aftermath of deregulation created large and persistent increases in Republican vote share in presidential, Senate, and House elections, which began in the early 1990s following repeal and continue through to today. Beyond voting, I show that areas experiencing greater post-repeal exposure to conservative talk radio also see greater increases in “deaths of despair,”—mortality related to substance use (including overdoses and alcohol-related illness) and suicide. These differences, which begin to surface in the mid-1990s, underscore that partisan media environments and ideological divergences can substantially reshape not only electoral outcomes but also public health, emphasizing the interconnectedness of political and health systems.

**Churches and Local Economies**<br>

How important are churches to local economic outcomes? Exploiting two plausibly exogenous shocks to church access and attendance, we study the causal effect of churches on a variety of economic and social outcomes. Using data from the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), we study: (1) unexpected pastor deaths, which precipitate church closures, and (2) SBC pastor convictions for sex crimes, which also alter local congregations and attendance. Across multiple data sources, we find that churches exert large positive effects on economic activity and wellbeing, and that these effects are partly due to the church's role in facilitating social connectedness.

This paper estimates the effects of fatal school shootings on youth psychotropic drug use over the subsequent 5.5 years. Using an event study approach that compares trends in drugs prescribed by providers practicing close to a school shooting relative to those practicing slightly farther away, we find that fatal school shootings lead to large increases in youth psychotropic drug use that persist for years after the event. These effects are driven primarily by increases in prescriptions for antidepressants and antipsychotics and are observed both among youth who were previously taking psychotropic medication and those who were not.
