**From the Dial to the Aisle: The Effects of Talk Radio** <br>

I study the political and health impacts of the widespread and sudden deregulation of radio content in the United States. In 1987, the Federal Communication Commission repealed its Fairness doctrine, which required radio broadcasters to devote equal time and/or opportunity to opposing viewpoints whenever discussing political issues. The sudden repeal of the doctrine led to immediate and widespread growth of the talk radio format, which became dominated by conservative voices such as Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, each of whom had reached than 10 million unique weekly listeners throughout the 2000s. I find that quasi-exogenous exposure to the rise of conservative talk radio in the aftermath of deregulation created large and persistent increases in Republican vote share in presidential, senate, and house elections, which began in the early 1990s following repeal and continue through to today. Additionally, I find areas most exposed to this new radio content experienced relative decreases in life expectancy, which emerged in the early 1990s and are driven in part by changes in risky health behavior.

**Churches and Local Economies**<br>
with <a href="https://zkashner.github.io/" class="no-underline">Zane Kashner</a> <br> 

How important are churches to local economic outcomes? Exploiting two plausibly exogenous shocks to church access and attendance, we study the causal effect of churches on a variety of economic and social outcomes. Using data from the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), we study: (1) unexpected pastor deaths, which precipitate church closures, and (2) SBC pastor convictions for sex crimes, which also alter local congregations and attendance. Across multiple data sources, we find that churches exert large positive effects on economic activity and wellbeing, and that these effects are partly due to the church's role in facilitating social connectedness.

This paper estimates the effects of fatal school shootings on youth psychotropic drug use over the subsequent 5.5 years. Using an event study approach that compares trends in drugs prescribed by providers practicing close to a school shooting relative to those practicing slightly farther away, we find that fatal school shootings lead to large increases in youth psychotropic drug use that persist for years after the event. These effects are driven primarily by increases in prescriptions for antidepressants and antipsychotics and are observed both among youth who were previously taking psychotropic medication and those who were not.
